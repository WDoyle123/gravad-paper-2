	abstractNote={The goal of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Project is to detect and study astrophysical gravitational waves and use data from them for research in physics and astronomy. LIGO will support studies concerning the nature and nonlinear dynamics of gravity, the structures of black holes, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. It will also measure the masses, birth rates, collisions, and distributions of black holes and neutron stars in the universe and probe the cores of supernovae and the very early universe. The technology for LIGO has been developed during the past 20 years. Construction will begin in 1992, and under the present schedule, LIGO’s gravitational-wave searches will begin in 1998.},

	abstract="Simulated annealing is a well-studied local search metaheuristic used to address discrete and, to a lesser extent, continuous optimization problems. The key feature of simulated annealing is that it provides a mechanism to escape local optima by allowing hill-climbing moves (i.e., moves which worsen the objective function value) in hopes of finding a global optimum. A brief history of simulated annealing is presented, including a review of its application to discrete, continuous, and multi-objective optimization problems. Asymptotic convergence and finite-time performance theory for simulated annealing are reviewed. Other local search algorithms are discussed in terms of their relationship to simulated annealing. The chapter also presents practical guidelines for the implementation of simulated annealing in terms of cooling schedules, neighborhood functions, and appropriate applications.",

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo Collaboration have cataloged eleven confidently detected gravitational-wave events during the first two observing runs of the advanced detector era. All eleven events were consistent with being from well-modeled mergers between compact stellar-mass objects: black holes or neutron stars. The data around the time of each of these events have been made publicly available through the gravitational-wave open science center. The entirety of the gravitational-wave strain data from the first and second observing runs have also now been made publicly available. There is considerable interest among the broad scientific community in understanding the data and methods used in the analyses. In this paper, we provide an overview of the detector noise properties and the data analysis techniques used to detect gravitational-wave signals and infer the source properties. We describe some of the checks that are performed to validate the analyses and results from the observations of gravitational-wave events. We also address concerns that have been raised about various properties of LIGO–Virgo detector noise and the correctness of our analyses as applied to the resulting data.}
